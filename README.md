# Mid-Term Revision Opportunity

This repository serves as the submission box for individual mid-term exam answer revisions. In order for a student to be eligible to revise mid-term exam answers, they must accept the optional assignment via GitHub Classroom. It is recommended that students either attend review sessions or discuss mid-term exam performance directly with the professor before completing this assignment, though neither are strictly necessary.

Students are encouraged to discuss questions and answers with the professor as often as necessary while completing this opportuity.

* Assigned: Monday, 21 October, 2019
* Review session: 25 October, 2019 (12:00PM - 1:00 PM)
* Due: Monday, 4 November, 2019

## Guidelines for revision

* Any question for which points were deducted is eligible for revision to reclaim _half_ (50%) of the points missed.
* All revisions must be logged using the `revisions.md` file located in the `writing` folder of this repository.
* Each revised response must include:
    * The question number labeled by a `heading` tag
    * A response which:
        * Clearly labels the correct answer
        * Uses code blocks if a revision of a reponse to a question involving code or any question in the `Code Completion` section
    * An explanation of both your understanding _before_ correcting the answer and a brief summary of how you _now_ understand the answer.

If you revise 5 questions, the document is expected to have 5 sets of the above elements.
   
## Scoring

* The maximum amount of credit available in this assignment will be rewarded for each question such that:
    * Responses include the required parts (listed above)
    * Revisions are committed to your copy of this repository by 4 November
    * Revisions demonstrate an honest effort to reconcile the original and correct answers
